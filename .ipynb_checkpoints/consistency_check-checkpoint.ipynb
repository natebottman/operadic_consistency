    "DEFINITION 1 (decomposing a question into a tree of questions).\n",
    "Given a question, we can decompose it into a number of sub-questions that need to be answered before answering the full question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose I have the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Who is older, Michael Jordan or Kyle Richardson?\n",
    "\n",

    "Given a tree of questions, we can \"fuse\" them into a single question. This is essentially the inverse operation of the decomposition process in definition 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFINITION 2 (fusion of a tree of questions). If T is a tree of questions, we can fuse them into a single question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say that our tree of questions is:\n",

    "Q1: What tribes are considered uncontacted? [A1]\n",
    "Q2: What are the populations of the tribes [A1]? [A2]\n",
    "Q3: Which of the numbers [A2] is the largest?\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, in the ToQ example above, suppose that we decide to collapse the Q1->Q3 arrow but not the Q2->Q3 arrow. Our ToQ is then divided into two sub-ToQs, where one has the Q1, Q3 nodes, and the other has the Q2 node.\n",

    "Then, we form the fusion (as in definition 2) of each of these sub-ToQs. The final result -- the so-called \"partial collapse\" associated to the original ToQ and the choice of which arrows to collapse -- will again be a ToQ (a smaller one).\n",
